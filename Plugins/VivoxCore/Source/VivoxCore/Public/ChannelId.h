     * \param domain The Vivox domain that provides service for this channel, for example: mt1s.vivox.com.
     * \param type The type of channel, each with built-in characteristics (for example, 3D positional effects).
     * \param properties The 3D properties of the channel. Note: This is optional, and is only used for positional channels.
     * \param unityEnvironmentId The Unity Environment Id, from the Unity Dashboard, to be embedded in the Accounts URI, primarily for Moderation requests
     * \param largeTextChannel When true, the SDK will mark the channel as a "large text" channel when joining. 
              Large text channels allow a significantly higher number of text participants (for example, up to ~2000 users
              instead of the default ~200) and require server-side support and entitlement. This is an enterprise-only
              feature; to enable it for your project, contact Vivox customer support or your Vivox representative.

              If enabled, the SDK will ensure the channel name used for the join includes the special "(t-largetext)"
              suffix (appending it if it is not already present). The SDK surface will continue to expose the
              human-friendly channel name (the suffix is removed for display/lookup); the large text designation is
              handled internally by the SDK and the Vivox service.
     * \remarks Name must not exceed 200 characters, and can only use the letters A-Z and a-z, the numbers 0-9, and the special characters =+-_.!~()%
